This was created using a combination of code writen by my professor and code that I wrote myself. 
The orignal application was a Netflix watclist app.

Using the Netlix idea as a precedent, I created an MLB watchlist app. My additions include a "Search by Team Name"
feature, and an SQL cause that selects all teams playing this week. 

The HTML and CSS is written by a friend.
